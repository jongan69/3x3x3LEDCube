# 3x3x3LEDCube
This is my original C code for controlling my 3x3x3 LED Cube written in Atmel Studio for Arduino Uno

The coede is well commented with what each line acommplishes and is made easier to use using the functions for turning the LEDs on and off.

I may revist this for making new animations, the tutorial of how I made the cube can be found here:
